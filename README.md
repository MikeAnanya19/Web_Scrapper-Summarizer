# Wikipedia Text Analysis and Summarization

## Overview

This Python script scrapes text from a specified Wikipedia page, processes the text using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and generates a summary. It also includes visualizations for word frequencies and a word cloud.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `nltk`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `transformers`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 nltk wordcloud matplotlib transformers
```

## Setup

Ensure you have downloaded the necessary NLTK data files. You can uncomment the following lines in the code to download them:

```python
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using Python:

     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```

2. **Input**:
   - When prompted, enter the topic for the Wikipedia page you want to analyze. For example: `F22`.

3. **Output**:
   - **Title**: The title of the Wikipedia page.
   - **Frequency Distribution Plot**: A plot of the most common words.
   - **Word Cloud**: A visual representation of word frequencies.
   - **Summary**: A concise summary of the Wikipedia page content.

## Code Breakdown

1. **Web Scraping**:
   - Retrieves the Wikipedia page content for the specified topic.
   - Extracts the text from the HTML content.

2. **Text Processing**:
   - **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words.
   - **Stopwords Removal**: Removes common words and punctuation.
   - **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base forms.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - Computes and plots the frequency distribution of words.
   - Generates a word cloud visualization.

4. **Summarization**:
   - Uses the BART model from the `transformers` library to generate a summary of the text.

## Example

```python
Enter the topic: F22
```

The script will output:
- The title of the page.
- A frequency distribution plot of the most common words.
- A word cloud visualization.
- A summary of the Wikipedia page content.

## Notes

- Ensure the Wikipedia page exists and is accessible.
- The summarization model's parameters (`max_length` and `min_length`) can be adjusted based on the desired summary length.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an "index out of range" error, check that the text is sufficiently long and ensure the tokenization and truncation steps are correctly handled.
- Make sure all libraries are properly installed and compatible with your Python version.
